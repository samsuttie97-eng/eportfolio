                <p> The purpose of this e-portfolio is to showcase my design of multimedia development skills.I explored how to plan, create, and evaluate a variety of digital learning materials using modern media tools. This course helped me understand how different forms of media, such as video, animation, graphics, and interactive tools, can work together to support effective learning experiences.<br><br>I have a Bachelor's in Psychology from the University of Central Florida and work for a state-funded agency that provides services to families and early childhood development centers. My goal is to leverage the skills I have developed in my professional years, combined with the newly acquired skills I gained during my graduate courses at the University of Central Florida, to become an Instructional Designer.  I enjoy creating engaging, interactive learning experiences and digital content, combining creativity with technology to support effective learning.</p>

					<h2>Digital Animation</h2>
					<p>Using Adobe Animate, I created a short animated sequence that explained why chameleons change color. I designed the graphics, added keyframes, added audio, and used motion or shape tweens to bring the elements to life. I also organized the layers, adjusted pacing, and exported the final animation.</p>
